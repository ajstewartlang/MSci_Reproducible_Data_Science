# First we need to load the packages we need - the following loads all packages 
# within the tidyverse universe of packages (plus associated datasets).
# If you haven't yet installed them on your computers, you'll first need to 
# type:
# install.packages("tidyverse")  
# install.packages("viridis")

library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

# One dataset that is included in the tidverse packages contains information 
# about the characters in the Star Wars movies.  The dataset is called 
# 'starwars'.  Note this is all lower case. R is sensitive to case - so 
# 'starwars' is not the same as 'StarWars'
# You can just type the name of the dataset to see the first 10 lines
starwars

# You can open the full dataset in a Viewing window
view(starwars)

# The following displays just the column called "name" in the "starwars" dataset
starwars %>% 
  select(name)

# Note this is the same as
select(starwars, name)
# But by using the pipe we can build up a sequence of functions as we'll see 
# below.

# The tally() function tells us how many elements are
starwars %>% 
  tally()

# We can add a group_by() so before the tally() is called, we have
# a grouping by homeworld. The tally is then done within those groups.
starwars %>%
  group_by(homeworld) %>%
  tally()

# If we want to order from the highest number of occurrences to the lowest
# we can use the sort parameter.

starwars %>%
  group_by(homeworld) %>%
  tally(sort = TRUE)

# We can check what other parameters the tally() function can take by typing
# either:

help(tally)

# or

?tally

# The following displays just the column called "homeworld" in the dataset - you'll see 
# lots of missing data that is indicated by "NA"
starwars %>%
  select(homeworld) %>%
  view()

# The distinct function gives us just the distinct (unique) homeworlds
starwars %>%
  select(homeworld) %>%
  distinct()

# The following uses the n_distinct to return the number of unique homeworlds
starwars %>%
  select(homeworld) %>%
  n_distinct() 

# The following displays just the column called "height" in the dataset
# Notice again that missing values are labelled as "NA"
starwars %>%
  select(height) %>%
  view()

# We can use the filter and is.na functions to filter out "NA" values in the 
# height column if we wanted to we could map the output of this onto a new 
# variable (we'll see how to do that in a bit)
starwars %>%
  select(height) %>%
  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%
  view()

# Now let's plot a basic histogram using the ggplot function.  ggplot is based 
# on the grammar of graphics and involves building up a plot layer by layer. 
# Below we tell ggplot we want to use the starwars dataset and set up our 
# aesthetics such that the x-axis corresponds to the height column. We then
# add the geom_histogram() layer which uses the information from the ggplot() 
# layer to build a histogram.
starwars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +

# We can now add a title and labels

# Use the facet_wrap function to plot separately by species - this will take a 
# little time.

# Now let's use the filter() function to filter only when we have Human and 
# Droid species.  The operator == means 'is equal to', '|' means OR and & means
# AND.
