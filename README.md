Classes start __Friday November 8th__ and run until __Friday December 13th__. 

The morning session is 1100-1300 and the afternoon session is 1400-1600 in Stopford PC Cluster 3.

## The Course Material

Each folder contains the slides in .pdf format, R scripts, all the data, and the worksheets associated with each of the 6 workshops.

## The Workshops
Workshop 1 - Reproducibility and R <br>
Workshop 2 - The General Linear Model (Regression) <br>
Workshop 3 - The General Linear Model (ANOVA) <br>
Workshop 4 - Mixed Models <br>
Workshop 5 - Data Simulation and Advanced Data Visualisation <br>
Workshop 6 - Reproducible Computational Environments and Presentations <br>

## Before the First Workshop - Installing R and RStudio

You will probably want to bring your laptop for this course (although we will be in a PC cluster in case you don't have a laptop). Beforehand, on your laptop you should install R (the language) and RStudio (the interface that helps us interact with R) - each is available for OSX, Windows, and various flavours of Unix. You can install R from here:

https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/

And RStudio from here:

## Online R Resources

Below are some helpful R resources - it would be useful to look at the first one before the workshop.

##### Online introductory guide to R, RStudio, and R Markdown.
This is a very clear and focused introduction to R, RStudio, and R Markdown.  You probably want to read the first four chapters sooner rather than later...

##### R for Data Science online book - Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
This is the online interactive version of the book of the same name.  It's a great book to introduce you to data science, reproducibility, and R.

## Running the Scripts via Binder

You can run the R scripts for this unit in your browser by launching the unit in a Binder. Once loaded, click on the .Rproj file associated with the workshop you want to go through. That will set the directory to point to the data files.<br> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ajstewartlang/MSci_Reproducible_Data_Science/master?urlpath=rstudio)
