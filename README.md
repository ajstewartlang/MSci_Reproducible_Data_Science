Slides for my 2019/20 MSci Reproducible Data Science unit.  Click on the __'Clone or download'__ button in the top right to download a zipped version of this repository.

Classes start __Friday November 8th__ and run until __Friday December 13th__. 

The morning session is 1100-1300 and the afternoon session is 1400-1600 in Stopford PC Cluster 3.

## Before the First Workshop - Installing R and RStudio

You will probably want to bring your laptop for this course (although we will be in a PC cluster in case you don't have a laptop). Beforehand, on your laptop you should install R (the language) and RStudio (the interface that helps us interact with R) - each is available for OSX, Windows, and various flavours of Unix. You can install R from here:

And RStudio from here:

## Online R Resources

Below are some helpful R resources - it would be useful to look at the first one before the workshop.

##### Online introductory guide to R, RStudio, and R Markdown.
This is a very clear and focused introduction to R, RStudio, and R Markdown.  You probably want to read the first four chapters sooner rather than later...

##### R for Data Science online book - Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
This is the online interactive version of the book of the same name.  It's a great book to introduce you to data science, reproducibility, and R.
